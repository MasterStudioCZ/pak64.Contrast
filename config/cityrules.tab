# now the actual building rules. They can be up to 7x7.
# allowed sizes are 3x3 5x5 and 7x7!
#

#
# Symbols in rules:
# S = must not be road
# s = must be road
# n = must be bare land
# H = must not be house
# h = must be house
# T = not a stop	// added in 88.03.3

# t = is a stop // added in 88.03.
# U = allowed slope for roads

# u = forbidden slope for roads

# . = anything matches
# SPACE = next row
#
# Each row must have EXACTLY the same number of members!
#


# build houses next to straight roads
house_1 = ..... .s... Ssn.. ..... .....
house_1.chance = -3

# build houses one row behind another house
house_2 = ..... ..... ..n.. ..h.. sss..
house_2.chance = -3

# extend existing road
road_1 = ..... .S... ssn.. .S... .....
road_1.chance = -6

# crossing road
road_2 = ..... ..... SSnS. sssS. ...S.
road_2.chance = -2

# crossing road 2
road_3 = ..... ..... ..n.. sssss ..s..
road_3.chance = -7

# game start
road_4 = h.. sn. ...
road_4.chance = 7
